Developer: Daihua Ye

UNITY is a great tool for developer to make 3d awesome games for windows, Mac, web and mobile app in android and iphone platform. I like UNITY is because UNITY provide few program languages for developer. As a web developer, I use javascript before. Then I know how to program in UNITY with Javascript. During the programing, I love the program structure that UNITY set up. First of all, it force you to program in object oriented style. Also, The importing feature fixes the problem of making 3d models problem in UNITY.

The Space War game is just the beginning project in UNITY. Later, I will make more and high quality games.
